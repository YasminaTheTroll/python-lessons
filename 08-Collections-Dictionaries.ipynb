    "\n",
    "Dictionaries, often called maps in non-Python contexts (for mathematical - not historical - reasons), are a \n",
    "slightly more generalized form of collection, implementing the most general form where an element has a unique \n",
    "location, and a way to access that location through some identifier value.\n",

    "value associated with it, though the value doesn't have to be unique. This is similar to real-life dictionaries where \n",
    "the keys are all of the words, and the values are the definitions of those words and any other information that particular \n",
    "dictionary might provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where dictionaries are unique though, is that the keys can be almost any kind of data (we won't get into the rules of \n",
    "that here), and the values can be literally anything that Python has to offer. All that needs to be true is that each \n",
    "key is unique. This means that keys can be strings, numbers (though usually just integers), or more complex types we'll \n",
    "come across later. Just about the only thing you can't use as a key is collections, which makes sense, since collections \n",
