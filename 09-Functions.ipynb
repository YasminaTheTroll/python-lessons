    "In a nutshell, functions allow you to take a chunk of code, or rather, a *block*, and wrap it up so you can call it \n",
    "multiple times. If this sounds somewhat familiar, and you're thinking of loops, you're not wrong. Loops are somewhat related, \n",
    "but conceptually serve a different purpose. What they share is the bundling of code so that it can be repeated. \n",
    "Where they differ is that functions create their own little environment that's separate from the outside world. Also, \n",
    "functions don't implicitly repeat the code they contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for declaring a function is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def <function-name>(<parameter-list>):\n",
    "    # Your code goes here...\n",
    "    # Don't forget the indentation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `function-name` follows the same rules as variables. `parameter-list` is an optional, comma-separated list of \n",
    "names that you can use in the function. The parameter list is similar to declaring a group of variables that can \n",
    "only be used inside the function. We'll specifically cover that more later.\n",
