    "## What is Python?\n",
    "In the world of programming, there are two major types of languages: *compiled* and *interpreted*\\*. Compiled \n",
    "languages take the code that's written and turns it into something the processor (CPU) can understand, all \n",
    "before the program can even be run. Interpreted languages, on the other hand, take the code, and run it \n",
    "through what's called an *interpreter*. The interpreter then does various actions based on what the code \n",
    "says, *while the program is running*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major difference between the two types is where the cost of turning the code into a program is biggest. \n",
    "In compiled languages, it's during the compilation phase, when the code is being translated to something the CPU \n",
    "can use. In interpreted languages, it's when the actual program is running, since the interpreter has \n",
    "to do the same work as the compiler, but it does it while the program is running. This makes for \n",
    "potentially faster development time, but slightly slower execution, whereas compiled code takes longer \n",
    "to develop, but runs much quicker. Keep in mind that one is not better than the other in general; which \n",
    "you use is heavily dependent on your needs, what the language offers, and what you're comfortable with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these two categories, Python is an interpreted language. What this means for you is that all you \n",
    "need to do to run your code is tell it to run! All of the heavy lifting is done by the Python \n",
    "interpreter, and you can focus on just writing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\* This isn't strictly true, but it's a useful simplification. Otherwise, things get messy real quick. In \n",
    "reality, most serious interpreted languages also do some form of compilation, but they do it while the code \n",
    "is running. This is referred to as *just-in-time* (JIT) compilation, and it's an incredibly powerful tool. \n",
    "Python uses this, but that really doesn't matter most of the time, and it's extremely unlikely to affect \n",
    "anything you'll be doing in the forseeable future."

    "by running parts of it through Python. Since Python is interpreted, it can update your results live and on-the-fly, \n",
    "meaning that you can write a little bit of code and immediately see what it does, which is important when you're \n",

    "the discretion of your grader. To answer a short answer exercise, double click on the area below that says something like \n",
