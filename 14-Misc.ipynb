    "functionally speaking, they're not much more than syntactical sugar for `for` loops over a list. That said, they're \n",
    "very useful, and extremely convenient when working with list data. Their primary use is to make a basic transformation \n",
    "to each element of a list, and return a new list with that transformation. The basic pattern looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[<expression> for <variable-name> in <collection>]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks a bit ike a mixed up `for` loop, but also in square brackets. And that's because, functionally, it kind of \n",
    "is. A list comprehension iterates over the collection you give it, assigning each value in turn to the variable you \n",
    "specify. Nothing new here, that's just a `for` loop. What's different is that the expression you \n",
    "put before the `for` gives the value that will take the position of the current value in the new list. That is, if \n",
    "you're on the 4th element, then the result of the expression will be the 4th element in the new list.\n",

    "\n",
    "Occasionally, when there's something wrong in your code, and your program is in a state that's completely unrecoverable, it's \n",
    "useful to have a means of immediately escaping form that situation. For example, what if some incorrect value is \n",
    "passed to a constructor? What should it return? It can't return a well-formed object, and you can't return \n",
    "anything else from a constructor, so there's nothing you can do. This is where *exceptions* can be used in Python. \n",
    "An exception is essentially just a class that inherits from Python's built-in `Exception` class. The important \n",
    "bit is how exactly to use exceptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use an exception, you need to *raise* or *throw* it (both terms are used interchangeably). Raising the exception \n",
    "means that your program will terminate immediately, wherever its at, regardless of the reason (though this isn't totally, \n",
    "but we'll get there in a little bit). You can raise an exception by use a `raise` statement, which is exactly \n",
    "what it sounds like.\n",
    "```\n",
    "raise <an-exception>\n",
    "```\n",
    "The effect of this is something you're likely already familiar with: the program crashes, and prints out a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plenty of kinds of exception built-in to Python ([full list here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html)).\n",
    "In general, if you can express your issue with one of these, it's best to do so. For example, if you have constructor \n",
    "that gets an incorrect value (or any function), the most applicable exception is a `ValueError` (just accept the name), \n",
    "since that's intended for invalid function arguments. This would be the exception we would throw in our hypothetical\n",
    "constructor above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an exception, all you need to do is create it like you would any other object: call the constructor for the \n",
    "class. Then you can raise the new exception object, and off we go! Usually, the constructor takes a string, meant \n",
    "to have a message describing the cause of the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a (not-so-great) (contrived) example, using our tried and true `hello` function type. In this case, we \n",
    "only want names (or something that could be a name), so we reject anything that isn't a string. The most applicable \n",
    "exception here is `TypeError`."

    "Usually, when you throw an exception, you don't want the end user to see that horrible message, since most people will \n",
    "have no idea what it means. Instead, you want to handle the exception at some point, generally at the level of your \n",

    "have to let the program crash, but do so gracefully, cleaning up any dangling threads you might leave. Most of the \n",

    "usually not all kinds. The exception class on the `except` line is just the name of the class you expect the \n",
    "exception object to be. If you want to do something with the exception, you can store it in a variable (often `e`). \n",
    "This can give you more information, if the exception provides it. Additionally, you can have multiple `except` \n",
